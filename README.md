## Features

### Authentication
- **Register** – Create account with username, email, password, gender, preferences, bio, and location
- **Login** – JWT-based authentication (7-day token validity)
- Password hashing with BCrypt
- Age restriction (18+ only)

### User Profile
- **Bio** – Short description (up to 500 characters)
- **Known As** – Display name
- **Gender** – Male, female, or other
- **Looking For** – Preferred gender
- **Location** – City and country
- **Date of birth** – Used for age calculation and filtering

### Photos
- Upload profile pictures (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp)
- Maximum 5MB per image
- Set main/profile photo
- Delete non-main photos

### Discovery & Swiping
- **Discovery** – Browse users with filters:
  - Gender, min/max age
  - Pagination (page size up to 50)
  - Order by last active or created date
- **Like (Swipe Right)** – Like another user
- **Likes** – View users you liked (`predicate=liked`) or who liked you (`predicate=likedby`)
- **Matches** – Mutual likes only

### Messaging
- Send direct messages between users
- Inbox, outbox, and unread views

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (or .NET 8/9)

---

## How to Run

### 1. Clone or open the project

```bash
cd c:\Users\shahi\Desktop\.net\API
```

### 2. Restore dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Run the API

```bash
dotnet run
```

The API starts on:
- **HTTPS:** https://localhost:5001
- **HTTP:** http://localhost:5000 (if configured)

### 4. Run with hot reload (during development)

```bash
dotnet watch run
```

---

## Configuration

Edit `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Development.json`:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` | SQLite connection string (default: `Data Source=datingapp.db`) |
| `TokenKey` | Secret key for JWT signing (must be 64+ characters for HMAC-SHA512) |
| `AdminUserNames` | Comma-separated usernames that receive the `Admin` role in JWT (optional; case-insensitive) |

**Admin access:** Users with `Users.IsAdmin = 1` in the database also receive the `Admin` role. After changing `IsAdmin` or `AdminUserNames`, log in again so a new JWT includes the role.

Example:

```json
{
  "AdminUserNames": "admin,support"
}
```

Example for production:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=production.db"
  },
  "TokenKey": "your-production-secret-at-least-64-characters-for-hmac-sha512"
}
```

## Database Migrations

Create a new migration:
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName
```

Apply migrations (done automatically on startup):
```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

## Quick Test with cURL

```bash
# Register
curl -X POST https://localhost:5001/api/account/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userName":"test","email":"test@test.com","password":"Test123!","gender":"male","lookingFor":"female","dateOfBirth":"1990-01-01"}'

# Login (use token from response)
curl -X POST https://localhost:5001/api/account/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userName":"test","password":"Test123!"}'

# Get discovery (replace TOKEN with your JWT)
curl -X GET "https://localhost:5001/api/users/discovery" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```
